# Pulumi Training Sessions 

Welcome to the Pulumi Training Sessions Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and practice your Pulumi skills with hands-on exercises and their corresponding solutions. Each training session is organized into two branches: an exercise branch and a solution branch.

## Branch Structure

The branches follow a naming convention to help you easily identify the content:

- **Exercise Branches**: Each exercise branch contains the starting code and instructions for the exercises. Each branch will follow a structure like the following `azure-cs/session-2-exercise` where it is prefixed with the cloud provider and language.
- **Solution Branches**: These branches include the completed code and detailed explanations of the solutions. An example would be `azure-cs/session-2-solution`

### Navigating the Repository

To switch between the exercise and solution branches, you can use the following git commands:

```sh
# To switch to an exercise branch
git checkout azure-cs/session-2-exercise

# To switch to a solution branch
git checkout azure-cs/session-2-solution
```
